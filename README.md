# LibreBox  

A Raspberry Pi + a router = your own private internet.  
Runs entirely offline, preloaded with knowledge packs - Wikipedia, Khan Academy, books, and more.  

No SIM. No ISP. No surveillance.

## Status
This is the **foundation build** â€”  
straight from the official PDF instructions,  
with clean scripts, configs, and docs.  

Upgrades coming in **LibreBox-Extended**.
